In sample.pdf created by R, we are getting text elements with a value of q.

For the paths, do we need to deal with the current transformation
  location, scaling.

  In KimShauman/inst/SampleCVs/CVTsoukiasweb_pdftohtml.xml, the <rect>
  has values that are 538, 5794, 4563, 5819 - so in the thousands for a
  page width and height 918 and 1188


Get colors of rectangles, etc.
  fill and line colors
